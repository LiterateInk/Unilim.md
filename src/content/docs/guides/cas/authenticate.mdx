import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

## Initialize

Let's try to authenticate to `cas.unilim.fr` using the given credentials.
Doing the following will create a new authentication session on their end,
thanks to [LemonLDAP::NG](https://lemonldap-ng.org/).

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label=".ts">
    ```typescript
    import { CAS, type PendingLogin } from "unilim/cas";
    const auth: PendingLogin = await CAS.initialize("username", "password");
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label=".rs">
    ```rust
    use unilim::cas::{ CAS, PendingLogin };
    let auth: PendingLogin = CAS::initialize("username", "password").await?;
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once a session has been initialized, you'll end up with a `PendingLogin` instance.
This is an intermediary step where you have to resolve a 2FA challenge if `solved` property is falsy.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label=".ts">
    ```typescript
    if (!auth.solved) {
      // You have to solve 2FA, check the "Resolve 2FA" section below.
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label=".rs">
    ```rust
    if !auth.solved {
      // You have to solve 2FA, check the "Resolve 2FA" section below.
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Resolve 2FA

You'll be asked to resolve a 2FA challenge when `solved` is falsy on `PendingLogin`.
This challenge can be either resolved through an email code or a previously registered TOTP code.

> This library **does not** support the case where you don't have any
> 2FA method attached to your account - they might prompt you to add one - so please add a 2FA method.

You might want to know which 2FA option is available, if you don't know.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label=".ts">
    ```typescript
    if (auth.isTotpAvailable) {
      // You can use TOTP method.
    }

    if (auth.isEmailAvailable) {
      // You can use the email code method.
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label=".rs">
    ```rust
    if auth.is_totp_available {
      // You can use TOTP method.
    }

    if auth.is_email_available {
      // You can use the email code method.
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

As a side note, if the 2FA was already solved both properties will be falsy, by default.

### TOTP

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label=".ts">
    ```typescript
    await auth.solveWithTotp("123456");
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label=".rs">
    ```rust
    auth.solve_with_totp("123456".into()).await?;
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You're done! You can go ahead to the [finish section](#finish).

### Email

This is split into two methods, one to send the email and the other to input
the code received.

> You **must not** call the [TOTP method](#totp) after
> calling the method to send an email, otherwise it'll fail.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label=".ts">
    ```typescript
    await auth.sendEmailCode();
    await auth.solveWithEmailCode("123456");
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label=".rs">
    ```rust
    auth.send_email_code().await?;
    auth.solve_with_email_code("123456".into()).await?;
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You're done! You can go ahead to the [finish section](#finish).

## Finish

Let's exchange our authentication session with an authenticated CAS instance.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label=".ts">
    ```typescript
    const cas = await auth.finish();
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label=".rs">
    ```rust
    let cas = auth.finish().await?;
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Restore

Once your session has expired, you'll have to create a new one.
Using the previously created session, you can make up a new one without
having to solve 2FA manually, thanks to the [`TrustedBrowser` plugin](https://gitlab.ow2.org/lemonldap-ng/lemonldap-ng/-/blob/v2.0/lemonldap-ng-portal/lib/Lemonldap/NG/Portal/Plugins/TrustedBrowser.pm) they enabled.

You'll need the cookie `llngconnection` and a key, generated on first authentication,
that you can retrieve using the following on an authenticated `CAS` instance.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label=".ts">
    ```typescript
    const llngconnection: string = cas.connection; // <- the cookie
    const key: string = cas.key; // <- the linked totp key
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label=".rs">
    ```rust
    let llngconnection: String = cas.connection; // <- the cookie
    let key: String = cas.key; // <- the linked totp key
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You'll still need `username` and `password` since this is not a refresh token.
It is only kind of a 2FA bypass.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label=".ts">
    ```typescript
    const cas: CAS = await CAS.restore(
      "username", "password", // <- the usual you'd give in initialize()
      llngconnection, key     // <- the variables we retrieved
    );
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label=".rs">
    ```rust
    let auth: CAS = CAS::restore(
      "username", "password", // <- the usual you'd give in initialize()
      llngconnection, key     // <- the variables we retrieved
    ).await?;
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

As you can see, we get directly a `CAS` instance and we don't have to
deal with `PendingLogin` anymore.

> Their cookie `llngconnection` is available for one month, after this
> it'll be expired and you'll have to go through a manual 2FA solve once again.

## Temporary

You can create a temporary CAS instance by providing a `lemonldap` cookie value.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label=".ts">
    ```typescript
    const cas: CAS = CAS.temporary("value");
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label=".rs">
    ```rust
    let cas: CAS = CAS::temporary("value".into());
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
